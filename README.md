# CODSOFT Internship Project Overview
This project contains several C++ programs, each with a different purpose. Here's a brief description of each:
---
```calculator.cpp```
This is a simple calculator program. It takes user input and performs basic arithmetic operations.
---
```guess_the_number.cpp```
This is a number guessing game. The program generates a random number and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
---
```image_processing.cpp```
This is an image processing tool built with Qt and OpenCV. It provides a GUI for users to open and save images, and potentially apply image processing operations.
---
```tictactoe.cpp```
This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Users can play multiple rounds and choose whether to play again after each round.
---
```todolist.cpp```
This is a simple to-do list manager. Users can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.
